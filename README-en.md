## 🗂️ Content Structure

This Wiki is organized following the **Effective Cursor Methodology (Six Steps)**, forming a complete loop from tools to workflow:

| Step | Name              | Core Goal                                        |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Tool Setup        | Make Cursor your truly handy development environment |
| 1    | Tech Stack        | Choose the most AI-friendly tech stack           |
| 2    | Engineering       | Establish engineering foundation                 |
| 3    | Agent Harness     | Systematically build the agent runtime environment |
| 4    | Workflow          | Deeply integrate AI into daily development       |
| 5    | Feedback & Iteration | Continuously iterate to improve AI effectiveness |

### Why This Order?

- Get tools ready, choose the right tech stack, and build a solid engineering foundation first to avoid "AI writes fast, debugging is painful"
- Rules are the highest leverage for reducing manual correction costs
- Standardized workflow transforms AI from "occasional helper" to "full-time collaborator"
- Feedback and iteration is key to maintaining productivity leadership
