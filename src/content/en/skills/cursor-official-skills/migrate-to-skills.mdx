# migrate-to-skills

<Callout type="info">
**Skill Name**: migrate-to-skills  
**Invocation**: `/migrate-to-skills` (manual only)  
**Purpose**: Migrate rules and slash commands to Skills format
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
This skill has `disable-model-invocation: true`, meaning the agent will not automatically invoke it. You must explicitly type `/migrate-to-skills` in the chat to use it.
</Callout>

## Skill Description

Convert 'Applied intelligently' Cursor rules (.cursor/rules/*.mdc) and slash commands (.cursor/commands/*.md) to Agent Skills format (.cursor/skills/). Use when the user wants to migrate rules or commands to skills, convert .mdc rules to SKILL.md format, or consolidate commands into the skills directory.

## Complete Skill Documentation

This skill automates the migration of legacy rules and commands to the new Skills format. The complete SKILL.md contains:

- **Migration Locations**: Project and user-level file discovery
- **Finding Files to Migrate**: Rules (with specific criteria) and commands (all)
- **Conversion Formats**: .mdc → SKILL.md and .md → SKILL.md transformations
- **Detailed Workflow**: Step-by-step migration process
- **Critical Requirement**: Preserve body content verbatim, no modifications

### Key Highlights

**What Gets Migrated:**

**Dynamic Rules** - Migrate if:
- Has `description` field
- NO `globs` pattern
- NO `alwaysApply: true`

**Slash Commands** - All commands are migrated with `disable-model-invocation: true`

**What Doesn't Get Migrated:**
- Rules with `alwaysApply: true`
- Rules with specific `globs` patterns
- Files in `~/.cursor/worktrees`
- Files in `~/.cursor/skills-cursor` (reserved for built-in skills)

**Conversion Examples:**

Rules: `.mdc` → `SKILL.md`
```markdown
# Before: .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
---
description: What this rule does
alwaysApply: false
---
Body content...

# After: .cursor/skills/my-rule/SKILL.md
---
name: my-rule
description: What this rule does
---
Body content...
```

Commands: `.md` → `SKILL.md`
```markdown
# Before: .cursor/commands/commit.md
# Commit current work
Instructions...

# After: .cursor/skills/commit/SKILL.md
---
name: commit
description: Commit current work with standardized message format
disable-model-invocation: true
---
# Commit current work
Instructions...
```

## Migration Process

1. Creates skills directories if needed
2. Discovers files to migrate
3. Converts each file to skill format
4. **Preserves body content exactly** (no reformatting or improvements)
5. Deletes original files after migration
6. Provides undo capability if requested

<Callout type="info">
After migration, if you want to restore the original files, simply ask the agent to "undo the migration" or "restore the original files."
</Callout>
