## Skill Description

Create custom subagents for specialized AI tasks. Use when the user wants to create a new type of subagent, set up task-specific agents, configure code reviewers, debuggers, or domain-specific assistants with custom prompts.

## Complete Skill Documentation

This skill guides you through creating custom subagents for Cursor. The complete SKILL.md contains:

- **When to Use Subagents**: Preserving context, specializing behavior, and reusing configurations
- **Subagent Locations**: Project-level vs user-level storage and priority rules
- **File Format**: YAML frontmatter structure and markdown body as system prompt
- **Writing Effective Descriptions**: Critical for delegation decisions
- **Example Subagents**: Code reviewer, debugger, and data scientist examples
- **Creation Workflow**: Step-by-step process from scope decision to testing
- **Best Practices**: Focus, detailed descriptions, version control, and proactive language
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Key Highlights

**Subagent Locations:**

| Location | Scope | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `.cursor/agents/` | Current project | Higher |
| `~/.cursor/agents/` | All your projects | Lower |

**File Format:**

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality and best practices
---

You are a code reviewer. When invoked, analyze the code and provide
specific, actionable feedback on quality, security, and best practices.
```

**Description Best Practices:**

- Be specific about capabilities
- Include "use proactively" to encourage automatic delegation
- Clearly state when to invoke the subagent

## Subagents vs Skills

| **System Prompt** | Has its own complete system prompt | No system prompt, just instructions |
| **Context** | Independent conversation context | Shares main agent's context |
| **Use Cases** | Isolated exploration, specialized behavior | Domain knowledge, workflow guidance |
