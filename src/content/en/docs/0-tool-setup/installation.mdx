# Installation & Configuration

> Get started with Cursor and begin your AI-assisted development journey

## Download & Install

Cursor is an AI-enhanced editor based on VS Code, supporting macOS, Windows, and Linux.

1. Visit [Cursor's website](https://cursor.sh) to download the installer for your system
2. Run the installer to complete the installation
3. On first launch, you'll be guided to log in or create an account

## Basic Configuration

### Project Indexing Optimization

Cursor automatically indexes your project to provide more accurate code suggestions. You can optimize indexing by:

- Using a `.cursorignore` file to exclude directories that don't need indexing (like `node_modules`, `dist`, etc.)
- For large projects, you can adjust the indexing strategy in settings

### Common Shortcuts

| Function | macOS | Windows/Linux |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| AI Chat | `Cmd + L` | `Ctrl + L` |
| Inline Edit | `Cmd + K` | `Ctrl + K` |
| Code Completion | `Tab` | `Tab` |

## Agent Configuration

### Auto-Run Mode

When Auto-Run mode is enabled, the Agent can automatically execute tool calls (such as command execution, file writes, etc.) without manual confirmation each time, significantly improving development efficiency.

Configure in `Settings` → `Cursor Settings` → `Features` → `Agent`:

#### Recommended Settings

- **Auto-Run Mode**: `Auto-Run in Sandbox` - Auto-run in sandbox, balancing efficiency and safety
- **Auto-Run Network Access**: `Ask Every Time` - Ask when network access is involved to avoid unexpected requests
- **Allow Git Writes Without Approval**: `✅ Enable` - Allow Git operations to execute automatically
- **Browser Protection**: `✅ Enable` - Prevent Agent from automatically opening browsers
- **File-Deletion Protection**: `As needed` - Whether to confirm file deletions
- **Dotfile Protection**: `✅ Enable` - Protect config files like `.gitignore`
- **External-File Protection**: `✅ Enable` - Prevent modifications outside workspace

#### Security Notice

<Callout type="warning">
When Auto-Run is enabled, the Agent will automatically execute tool calls. Please note:

- **Be Cautious with External Data Sources** - Avoid introducing external prompts that may contain malicious instructions (Be cautious of potential prompt injection risks from external sources)
- **Review Generated Commands** - Before critical operations, check the commands the Agent plans to execute
- **Commit Frequently** - Keep commits small to facilitate rollback anytime
- **Develop in Branches** - Let the Agent experiment freely in separate branches

Auto-Run can dramatically improve efficiency when used correctly, but requires basic awareness of project and Agent behavior.
