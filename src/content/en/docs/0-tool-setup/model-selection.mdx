# Model Selection

> Choose the right AI model for your task

Cursor supports multiple AI models, each with its own strengths and use cases. Choosing the right model helps balance effectiveness and cost.

## Model Recommendation and Selection Strategy

- **Prefer the latest Claude / Gemini models** - Strongest code generation and understanding capabilities
- **Thinking models perform better** - Models with 🧠 symbol support Thinking but consume 2x Usage
- **Add custom non-Thinking models** - e.g., `claude-4.5-sonnet` (1x Usage) for simple tasks to save quota

## Coding Model Leaderboard Reference

Want to understand how different AI models perform on programming tasks? Check out the [LMArena Coding Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/zh/leaderboard/text/coding), which is based on real user blind testing votes and objectively reflects the performance differences of various models in code generation, debugging, and other tasks.

Key insights from the leaderboard:
- **Claude Opus 4.5** and **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking)** perform best in programming tasks
- **Gemini 3 Pro** and **Grok 4.1 (Thinking)** also show excellent coding capabilities
- Thinking versions generally perform better in complex programming tasks


| Scenario | Recommended Model | Usage Multiplier | Description |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Daily Coding | claude-4.5-opus-high | 2x | Most powerful model, cost-effective, suitable for daily coding |
| Simple Tasks | claude-4.5-sonnet | 1x | Save quota, suitable for simple tasks |

> **Tip for Context Usage**: With powerful models like Opus, using more context in a single request is cost-effective. This makes techniques like [progressive memory disclosure](/en/docs/3-cursor-rules/memory-management) particularly valuable—let the Agent read as much relevant context as needed within one session.
