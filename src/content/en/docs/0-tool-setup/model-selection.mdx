# Model Selection

> Choose the right AI model for your task

Cursor supports multiple AI models, each with its own strengths and use cases. Choosing the right model helps balance effectiveness and cost.

## Model Recommendation and Selection Strategy

- **Prefer the latest Claude / Gemini models** - Strongest code generation and understanding capabilities
- **Thinking models perform better** - Models with 🧠 symbol support Thinking but consume 2x Usage
- **Add custom non-Thinking models** - e.g., `claude-4.5-sonnet` (1x Usage) for simple tasks to save quota

| Scenario | Recommended Model | Usage Multiplier | Description |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Daily Coding | claude-4.5-opus-high | 2x | Most powerful model, cost-effective, suitable for daily coding |
| Simple Tasks | claude-4.5-sonnet | 1x | Save quota, suitable for simple tasks |
