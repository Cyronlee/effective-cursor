# MCP Tools

> Extend AI's capabilities with MCP

## What is MCP

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that allows AI models to interact with external tools and data sources. Through MCP, Cursor gains capabilities beyond pure text processing.

- 📁 Read and manipulate the file system
- 💻 Execute terminal commands
- 🗄️ Access databases
- 🌐 Call external APIs
- 🔧 Integrate with other development tools

<Callout type="info">
**Official Documentation**: For complete MCP usage guide, see [Cursor MCP Official Docs](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp)
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Important Notice**: Every time Cursor opens a new project, all MCP tools default to Active state.

Make sure to manually disable MCP tools you don't need. Too many active MCP tools will:
- Increase system prompt length
- Distract the AI model's attention
- Lead to poor generation quality

**Recommendation**: Only enable specific MCP tools when needed, and disable them promptly after use.
</Callout>

## Recommended MCP Tools

Here are some commonly used and practical MCP tool configurations. For more tools, see the [MCP Tools Directory](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp/directory).

### Figma MCP

Connect Figma designs directly to Cursor. AI can read elements, styles, and layout information from your designs, helping you quickly transform designs into code.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Figma": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**Setup**: Refer to the official [Guide to the Figma MCP server](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Figma-MCP-server)

---

### Jira MCP

Connect to Jira project management system. AI can read issue details, comments, and status, helping you understand requirements and task context.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "jira-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "JIRA_INSTANCE_URL": "https://your-company.atlassian.net",
        "JIRA_USER_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
        "JIRA_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Getting API Key**: Log into your Atlassian account and generate a key at [API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

---

### PostgreSQL MCP

Connect directly to PostgreSQL databases. AI can query table structures and data, helping you write SQL and understand data models.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres",
        "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="error">
**Security Note**: Use read-only accounts when connecting to production databases to avoid accidental modifications.
</Callout>

---

### Browser MCP (Playwright)

Control the browser for automated testing and web interactions. AI can simulate user actions and take screenshots.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-playwright"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Tips

- **Principle of least privilege** - Only enable MCP tools needed for the current task
- **Review operations** - Carefully check AI suggestions for dangerous operations
- **Sensitive data** - Use read-only accounts for database connections and similar MCP tools
- **Disable promptly** - Turn off MCP tools you no longer need after completing tasks

## Summary

MCP tools greatly expand the possibilities of AI-assisted development, evolving Cursor from a code editor into a complete development assistant. Properly configuring and managing MCP tools can significantly boost your development efficiency.
