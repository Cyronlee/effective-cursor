# Collaboration Software

> In the AI-assisted development era, tool selection matters more than ever

In AI-assisted development workflows, collaboration tools are not just "assistants" — they're critical components for ensuring code quality, accelerating iterations, and maintaining project context. Choose the right tools, and AI transforms from "occasional helper" to "full-time collaborator."

## Version Control: Git

### Why Git is Essential

In AI-assisted development, Git's importance is amplified:

- **Prevent AI from Breaking Code** - AI might mistakenly modify critical code; Git lets you roll back anytime
- **Quickly Compare Changes** - When AI generates large amounts of code, Git diff helps you spot issues fast
- **Safe Experimentation** - Use branches to let AI experiment freely without affecting the main branch
- **Foundation for Collaboration** - Team collaboration and CI/CD are built on Git

### Recommended Configuration

```bash
# Set up a commit template
git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage

# Enable automatic spelling correction
git config --global help.autocorrect 1

# Global ignore file
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

## Git Client: Fork

### Why Fork is Recommended

In fast-iterating AI projects with frequent code changes, Fork's visualization capabilities are especially valuable:

- **Quick Diff Review** - Visual comparison helps you rapidly review AI-generated code changes
- **Timeline Preview** - In rapid iterations, intuitive commit history helps you understand project evolution
- **Clear Branch Management** - AI often needs to switch between branches for experiments; Fork makes this intuitive
- **Friendly Conflict Resolution** - When AI-generated code creates conflicts, visual tools greatly reduce resolution difficulty

### Alternatives

- **GitKraken** - Feature-rich, supports team collaboration
- **Sourcetree** - From Atlassian, free to use
- **Command line** - Most direct approach; AI can also generate Git commands

## API Testing: Bruno

### Why Bruno Works Well with AI

Bruno's biggest advantage is **file-based Git management**, allowing AI to directly participate in API documentation maintenance:

- **Git-Friendly** - API requests are stored as `.bru` files, directly version-controlled
- **AI-Maintainable** - AI can read and write `.bru` files, automatically updating API documentation
- **Local-First** - No cloud account required; you have full control over your data
- **Team Sync** - Share API collections via Git, ensuring the team uses the same test cases

```
collections/
├── api/
│   ├── users/
│   │   ├── get-user.bru         # AI can update directly
│   │   └── create-user.bru      # AI can update directly
│   └── orders/
│       └── list-orders.bru
└── environments/
    ├── local.bru
    └── production.bru
```

## Documentation Tools: Nextra

### Why Documentation Tools Matter

In AI-assisted development, documentation isn't just for humans — it's key to providing **project context** for AI:

- **Rapid Project Understanding** - AI can read Markdown docs to quickly grasp project architecture and conventions
- **Context Transfer** - Attach documentation files to AI conversations to provide necessary background
- **Knowledge Accumulation** - Good documentation helps AI generate code that better fits project conventions
- **Version Sync** - Markdown files can be version-controlled alongside code, maintaining consistency

### Why Nextra is Recommended

[Nextra](https://nextra.site) is a Next.js-based documentation framework, particularly suitable for AI-assisted development:

- **MDX Support** - Embed React components in documentation; AI can maintain both docs and components
- **File-based Routing** - File structure defines navigation structure; AI can easily understand and modify
- **TypeScript-Friendly** - Configuration files use TypeScript, providing type hints for AI-generated code
- **Built-in Search** - Automatically generates search index with no extra configuration
- **Fast Hot Reload** - Based on Next.js, excellent development experience

### AI Collaboration Advantages

When using Nextra, AI can:

1. **Edit Documentation Directly** - Attach `.mdx` files in conversations for AI to update content
2. **Sync Navigation Updates** - Modify `_meta.tsx` files; AI understands navigation structure
3. **Auto-generate Examples** - Embed interactive code examples in documentation
4. **Maintain Multilingual Docs** - AI can maintain Chinese and English docs simultaneously with consistent structure

### Alternatives

- **Docusaurus** - React-powered, from Meta, feature-complete
- **VitePress** - Vue-powered, lightweight and fast
- **GitBook** - Team knowledge base, suitable for non-technical users

### Documentation Best Practices

1. **Docs as Code** - Write in Markdown/MDX, version control with code
2. **Structured Organization** - Clear directory structure helps AI locate information
3. **Keep Updated** - Have AI update related docs when modifying code
4. **Context Attachment** - Attach relevant documentation files when conversing with AI to provide context
5. **Use Frontmatter** - Add metadata at the beginning of docs to help AI understand document types

## Design Collaboration: Figma + MCP

### Advantages of Figma MCP

Through Figma MCP, AI can directly read design files:
- **Design to Code** - AI understands elements, styles, and layouts in design files
- **Maintain Consistency** - Automatically extract colors, fonts, and other specs from the design system
- **Accelerate Development** - Reduce time converting from design to code

See the [MCP Tools](/en/docs/0-tool-setup/mcp-tools) section for details.

## Summary

| Tool Type | Recommended | Core Value |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Version Control | Git | Prevent AI errors, enable rollback anytime |
| Git Client | Fork | Quick diff review, timeline preview |
| API Testing | Bruno | Git file management, AI-maintainable |
| Documentation | Docusaurus/VitePress/Nextra | Maintain project context, quickly attach to AI conversations |
| Design Collaboration | Figma + MCP | Design files directly to code |

Choose the right collaboration software to make AI not just a "code writing tool," but truly integrated into your development workflow.
