# Extensions

> Curated extensions to boost your development efficiency

Cursor is fully compatible with the VS Code extension ecosystem. Here are some recommended extensions that work perfectly with AI-assisted development.

## Code Quality

### Prettier

An automatic formatting tool that unifies code style. AI-generated code often doesn't match your project's formatting standards—Prettier can format it to a unified style with one click.

<ImageZoom 
  src="/img/extensions/prettier.png" 
  alt="Prettier Extension" 
  width={300} 
  style={{ borderRadius: '8px', marginTop: '16px' }}
/>

1. Set Default Formatter to Prettier
2. Enable Format On Save for automatic formatting
3. Use `Cmd/Ctrl + S` to automatically format code on save

<ImageZoom 
  src="/img/extensions/prettier-config.png" 
  alt="Prettier Configuration" 
  width={600} 
  style={{ borderRadius: '8px', marginTop: '16px' }}
/>

## Documentation Management

### Markdown All in One

Enhanced Markdown editing with keyboard shortcuts, table formatting, table of contents generation, and more. Very useful when writing prompts and project documentation.

### Markdown Preview Mermaid Support

Enables Mermaid diagram rendering in Markdown preview. AI can generate flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and architecture diagrams using Mermaid syntax—with this extension, you can preview them directly in the editor.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Requirements] --> B[AI Generates Code]
    B --> C[Human Review]
    C --> D[Iterate & Improve]
```
