# Feedback & Iteration

> Continuously iterate to improve AI-assisted effectiveness

## Chapter Goals

AI-assisted development is not a one-time setup. Models evolve, teams grow, and projects change. Establishing effective feedback mechanisms is the key to continuously improving AI-assisted development outcomes.

This chapter will help you:

- Build a scientific metrics framework
- Design feedback collection mechanisms suited to your team
- Master efficient retrospective methods
- Learn from real team experiences

**Teams without feedback**:
- Everyone explores alone, repeatedly stepping on the same pitfalls
- Good practices cannot be documented and shared
- Cursor Rules become bloated with declining effectiveness
- No clarity on how much value AI assistance actually brings

**Teams with feedback mechanisms**:
- Quickly discover AI capability boundaries
- Continuously optimize Prompts and Rules
- Build team-level best practice libraries
- Make data-driven decisions for continuous improvement
