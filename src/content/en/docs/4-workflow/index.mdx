# Workflow

> Deeply integrate AI into your daily development workflow for improved efficiency and code quality

## Core Focus

- **Tasking, designing, coding for accuracy** — Break down tasks, design solutions, write precise code
- **AI-assisted development, human-focused innovation** — Let AI assist, while humans drive innovation

In previous chapters, we established Cursor Rules to constrain AI-generated code boundaries and configured automated detection and fixes. With these safeguards in place, all the modes introduced below can produce high-quality code.

## Chapter Goals

Through this chapter, you will learn:

- Understand the **use cases** for four Cursor usage modes
- Learn to **choose the right mode** based on task complexity
- Master the **Draft-Final** mode for complex task development
- Establish a **standard workflow** from requirements to deployment
