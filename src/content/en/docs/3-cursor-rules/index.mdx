# Introduction

> Keep AI-generated code within controllable boundaries

In previous chapters, we completed tool setup, tech stack selection, and scaffolding. Now that the project skeleton is in place, it's time to **make AI understand and follow your project standards**.

## Core Concept: Rules as Constraints

Cursor Rules are the "contract" between you and AI. Through clear rule definitions, you can:

| Goal | Without Rules | With Rules |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **Code Style** | AI randomly chooses styles | Consistently follows project standards |
| **Architecture** | Code may be misplaced | Automatically placed in correct directories |
| **Tech Choices** | May use wrong libraries | Uses specified tech stack |
| **Best Practices** | Different implementations each time | Consistent implementation patterns |

## Chapter Goals

Through this chapter, you will master:

- **Writing principles** and best practices for Cursor Rules
- What rules to write at **different stages** of project development
- Using **meta prompts** to quickly generate rule frameworks

## Layered Rule Design

A complete rule system typically includes the following layers:

```
.cursor/rules/
├── global-rules.mdc      # 🌍 Global Rules (always active)
│                         #    Tech stack, directory structure, TypeScript standards
│
├── routing-rules.mdc     # 🛣️ Routing Rules (active for pages/**)
│                         #    Page structure, route protection, auth flow
│
├── api-rules.mdc         # 🔌 API Rules (active for clients/**)
│                         #    HTTP client, data fetching, error handling
│
└── ui-rules.mdc          # 🎨 UI Rules (active for *.tsx)
                          #    Component usage, icon system, theme config
```
