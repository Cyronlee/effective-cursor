# Cursor Rules Writing Best Practices

> Make AI strictly follow your project's unique requirements

## Core Philosophy

The sole mission of Cursor Rules is: **Make AI-generated code conform to your project's unique standards**.

Many people mistakenly think Rules should contain various "best practices" and general knowledge. In reality, large language models already know these. What you need to tell AI is: **In this project, we do it this way**.

| Common Mistake | Correct Approach |
|----------------|------------------|
| ❌ "Use meaningful variable names" | ✅ "Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components" |
| ❌ "Follow React best practices" | ✅ "All page components go in `src/pages/`, use default exports" |
| ❌ "Write clean code" | ✅ "Use `@/` as import path prefix, avoid barrel exports" |

## Six Core Principles

### 1. Be Extremely Specific and Actionable

Only write mandatory standards unique to your project, avoid vague descriptions.

```markdown
// ❌ Vague rules
- Use TypeScript for type-safe development
- Follow component design principles

// ✅ Specific rules
- Avoid `any`, use `unknown` for uncertain types
- Use interface for object shapes, type for unions
- Exported functions must specify return types
```

### 2. Keep It Short, Cut the Fluff

Each rule should be 1-3 lines, single `.mdc` file should be 100-200 lines max.

Common knowledge that LLMs already know doesn't need repeating. Things like "functions should have single responsibility" - AI already knows this.

```markdown
// ❌ Verbose explanation
Date Formatting Guidelines: In this project, we use a unified date formatting 
approach to ensure consistency across all date displays. When you need to 
format dates, please make sure to use our wrapper utility function instead 
of native APIs or third-party libraries directly...

// ✅ Concise rule
- Use `formatDate()` from `@/lib/date-time-utils.ts` for date formatting
- Use `formatMoney()` from `@/lib/money-utils.ts` for money formatting
```

### 3. Split Files, Match Precisely

Split rule files by topic in `.cursor/rules/` directory, use `globs` to limit scope.

| Rule File | Scope | When Triggered |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `global-rules.mdc` | `alwaysApply: true` | Always active |
| `routing-rules.mdc` | `globs: src/pages/**` | When editing page files |
| `api-rules.mdc` | `globs: src/clients/**` | When editing API clients |
| `ui-rules.mdc` | `globs: *.tsx` | When editing component files |

```yaml
# global-rules.mdc - Core standards always active
---
alwaysApply: true
---

# api-rules.mdc - Only active when editing API-related files
---
globs: src/clients/**
alwaysApply: false
---
```

### 4. Provide Concrete Examples

Include import locations and code examples to reduce AI guessing and unify project standards.

```markdown
// ❌ Just telling
- Use SWR for data fetching

// ✅ Complete example
## SWR Integration

import useSWR from 'swr'
import { getUserInfo, getUserInfoKey } from '@/clients/user/get-user-info'

const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(
  getUserInfoKey(id),
  () => getUserInfo(id)
)
```

### 5. Start Small, Iterate Fast

Don't try to write perfect rules from the start.

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Start** | Add 3-5 rules for current pain points |
| **Test** | Immediately test AI output |
| **Iterate** | Supplement or adjust based on issues |

When you find AI repeatedly making the same mistake, that's the time to add a new rule.

### 6. Configure Toolchain

Let AI automatically run toolchain verification after completing tasks.

```markdown
## Quality Standards

- Ensure `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passes before commits
- Run `npm test` to verify changes don't break existing functionality
```

## Rule Structure Template

A complete rule file typically contains these sections:

```markdown
---
globs: src/components/**
alwaysApply: false
---

# [Rule Name]

## [Category 1]
- Specific rule item
- Another rule

## [Category 2]

### Example
Code example...

## Related Files
- `@/lib/xxx.ts` - Description
- `@/types/xxx.ts` - Description
```

## Team Collaboration

Project rules must be committed to Git, this ensures:

- All team members use the same rules
- Rule changes have traceable history
- New members can quickly understand project standards

```
.cursor/
└── rules/
    ├── global-rules.mdc
    ├── routing-rules.mdc
    ├── ui-rules.mdc
    └── api-rules.mdc
```
