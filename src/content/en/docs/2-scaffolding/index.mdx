# Introduction

> Set up architecture and automation systems early, let AI run efficiently on safe tracks

## Quick Start

In the previous chapter, we completed technology selection. Now it's time to initialize your project or optimize your existing project structure.

### New Projects: Use Scaffolds

If you're starting from scratch, we recommend these battle-tested starter templates:

| Tech Stack | Recommended Scaffold | Features |
|------------|---------------------|----------|
| **React/Next.js** | [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) | Modern UI components, native TypeScript support |
| **Next.js Enterprise** | [next-enterprise](https://github.com/Blazity/next-enterprise) | Enterprise-grade architecture with complete toolchain |
| **Spring Boot** | [spring-boot-boilerplate](https://github.com/Genc/spring-boot-boilerplate) | Production-ready backend template |

### Existing Projects: Optimize

If you already have a project, you can directly apply the practices in this chapter:
- **Project structure optimization**: Reorganize directories, split large files
- **Toolchain configuration**: Introduce static analysis, testing, CI/CD

## Core Concept: Architecture First

In the era of AI-assisted development, many believe they can let AI "freely explore" to build systems. However, practice has shown that **without a solid engineering foundation, AI tends to introduce deviations, technical debt, or low-quality output**.

### The Restaurant Analogy

| Restaurant Element | Software Architecture | Who's Responsible |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 🏗️ Kitchen Layout | System architecture, directory structure | **Humans** must carefully plan |
| 📋 Menu Design | API design, interface contracts | **Humans** define contracts |
| 🍳 Cooking Process | Business logic implementation | **AI** implements efficiently |
| 🔍 Health Inspection | Static analysis, testing | **Tools** provide automatic feedback |

Just as an excellent executive chef must first design the kitchen layout and workflow to enable the culinary team to operate efficiently, **humans must manually establish a solid architectural foundation at the beginning of the project**.

## Automation Tool Layering

When introducing automation tools, the key is to **identify which tools are suitable for the AI workflow and which should remain in automated/manual processes**.

### 🤖 Tools in AI Workflow

These tools should be integrated into AI's work loop, providing **instant feedback**:

| Tool Type | Examples | How AI Uses It |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Type Checking** | TypeScript, mypy | AI checks type errors immediately after generating code |
| **Linter** | ESLint, Ruff | AI auto-fixes code style based on lint errors |
| **Unit Testing** | Vitest, PyTest | AI runs tests to verify functionality |
| **Formatting** | Prettier, Black | AI auto-formats output code |

**Principle: Don't add too many tools to the AI workflow.** Each additional tool increases AI's cognitive load and execution time. Keep only core tools that provide **deterministic feedback**.

### ⚙️ Tools in Automated Processes

These tools should run in **automated processes**, not in the AI workflow:

| Tool Type | Examples | Trigger Timing |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Pre-commit Hook** | husky + lint-staged | When developer commits code |
| **Pre-push Hook** | Full test suite | Before pushing code |
| **CI Checks** | GitHub Actions | When PR is created/updated |
| **Security Scanning** | Dependabot, Snyk | Periodically or on PR |

### 🧑‍💻 Tools in Manual Processes

These require human judgment and are not suitable for full automation:

| Tool Type | Examples | Why Human Needed |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Code Review** | GitHub PR Review | Requires understanding business context and architectural intent |
| **Architecture Decisions** | ADR documents | Requires global perspective and long-term thinking |
| **Dependency Upgrades** | Major version upgrades | Requires evaluating impact of breaking changes |

## Feedback Loop Design

Good engineering architecture creates a **fast feedback loop**:

```
Developer intent → AI generates code → Tools detect instantly → Feedback to AI → AI fixes → Validation passes
```

### Why Feedback Loops Matter?

| Feature | Traditional Tool Feedback | AI Self-Assessment |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Determinism** | ✅ Clear rules, consistent results | ❌ May hallucinate |
| **Coverage** | ✅ 100% checks all code | ❌ May miss edge cases |
| **Speed** | ✅ Millisecond response | ⚠️ Requires extra inference time |
| **Reliability** | ✅ Tools don't lie | ❌ AI may be overconfident |
