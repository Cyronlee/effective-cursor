# Engineering Foundation

> Establish engineering foundation to lay a solid architecture for AI development

## Chapter Goals

In the era of AI-assisted development, many believe they can let AI "freely explore" to build systems. However, practice has shown that **without a solid engineering foundation, AI tends to introduce deviations, technical debt, or low-quality output**.

This chapter introduces how to establish engineering foundations for AI development:

| Section | Content | Core Concept |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| [Engineering Architecture](./engineering-architecture) | Architecture first, modular design | Humans lay foundation, AI builds |
| [Architecture Design](./architecture-design) | Directory structure, strong typing, interface contracts | Constraints are freedom |
| [Static Analysis Tools](./static-analysis) | ESLint, Ruff, SpotBugs | Deterministic feedback |
| [Automated Testing](./automated-testing) | Vitest, PyTest, Playwright | Verify correctness |
| [CI/CD Pipeline](./ci-cd) | GitHub Actions, pipelines | Automated loop |

## Core Concepts

### 🏗️ Architecture First

Imagine a restaurant: the kitchen layout (system architecture) must be carefully planned by humans before the culinary team (AI) can operate efficiently.

**Humans must manually establish a solid architectural foundation** for AI to run efficiently on safe tracks.

### 🔄 Feedback Loop

```
AI generates code → Tools detect issues → Feedback to AI → AI fixes → Re-check → Pass
```

Traditional tools (Linters, tests) provide **deterministic, high-coverage** feedback, avoiding AI hallucinations or subjective bias.

### 📏 Constraints Are Freedom

Architecture designed for AI development is not about letting AI "freely explore," but building:

- **Strict Rules**: Clear type definitions, interface contracts, code standards
- **Fast Feedback**: Real-time lint checks, type validation, test runs
- **Small Iterations**: Modular design, handling one small task at a time

## Key Principles

1. **Humans handle architecture, AI handles implementation** — Architecture decisions require global perspective and long-term thinking
2. **Tools provide feedback, AI responds with fixes** — Create a continuous improvement loop
3. **Clearer constraints, more efficient AI** — Clear rules beat vague guidance
4. **Small iterations, frequent validation** — Every change should be testable and reversible
