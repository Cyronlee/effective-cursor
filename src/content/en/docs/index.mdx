# Getting Started

Welcome to the **Effective Cursor** Wiki!

This is an engineering knowledge base summarized by our team from long-term practice in AI-assisted development. All content comes from real-world successes and failures using Cursor in actual projects. Our goal is to help developers (and teams) systematically establish an efficient, reliable, and practical AI-assisted development system, rather than scattered "ask and copy" approaches.

Our core belief: **AI is not a magic bullet, but a productivity tool that can be continuously amplified through engineering practices**. Only by forming a complete loop from tool configuration and tech stack selection to rule constraints and workflow standards can Cursor truly become your "super partner" in daily development.

### Effective Cursor Methodology (Six Steps)

| Step | Name              | Core Goal                                        | Key Actions                              |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Tool Setup        | Make Cursor your truly handy development environment | Installation, UI familiarization, shortcuts, project indexing, model selection |
| 1    | Tech Stack        | Choose the most AI-friendly tech stack           | Prioritize strongly-typed, well-structured, mature ecosystems (TypeScript + React/Next.js, NestJS/FastAPI, etc.) |
| 2    | Engineering       | Establish engineering foundation                 | Configure Lint/Format, automated testing framework, CI/CD pipeline to ensure AI-generated code is trustworthy |
| 3    | Cursor Rules      | Make AI automatically follow team standards      | Write project/personal level Rules to constrain coding style, architecture, layering, dependencies |
| 4    | Workflow          | Deeply integrate AI into daily development       | Define standard flow from PRD → Design → Breakdown → Generation → Review → Deploy, master structured Prompts & Composer |
| 5    | Feedback & Iteration | Continuously iterate to improve AI effectiveness | Regularly review Prompts & Rules, collect model performance feedback, update template library, share best practices |

### Why This Order?

These steps are the engineering path refined by our team through repeated trial and error across multiple projects:
- Get tools ready, choose the right tech stack, and build solid engineering foundations first to avoid "AI writes fast, debugging is painful".
- Rules are the highest leverage for reducing manual correction costs.
- Standardized workflow transforms AI from "occasional helper" to "full-time collaborator".
- Feedback and iteration is key to maintaining productivity leadership.

### Recommended Reading Path

1. Beginners: Start from **0. Tool Setup**, practice each module in sequence.
2. Experienced users: Prioritize **3. Cursor Rules** and **4. Workflow** for quick visible improvements.
3. Continuous improvement: Regularly return to **5. Feedback & Iteration**, and contribute your great Prompts and Rules to the template library.
