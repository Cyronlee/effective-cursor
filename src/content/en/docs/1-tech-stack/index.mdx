# AI-Friendly Tech Stack

> From "writing code" to "describing intent" — choose technologies that speak AI's language

In the age of AI-assisted development with tools like Cursor, Copilot, and Claude, technology selection has gained a new dimension: **AI-friendliness**. 

LLMs don't write code like humans do. They work through **natural language → semantic inference → structured output**. This mechanism means:

- **Less ambiguity = higher generation quality**
- **More explicit structure = lower refactoring cost**  
- **More declarative expression = better AI comprehension**

The right tech stack doesn't just improve your productivity — it fundamentally determines how effectively AI can assist you. This chapter analyzes which technologies are truly AI-friendly and helps you make informed decisions.
