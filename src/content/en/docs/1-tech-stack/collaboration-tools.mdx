## Collaboration Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Docs as code** - Write documentation in Markdown, version control with code
2. **API spec first** - OpenAPI/Swagger specs help AI understand interfaces
3. **Unified coding standards** - Share ESLint, Prettier configs for consistent AI-generated code
4. **Structured commits** - Use Conventional Commits for AI to understand change history

## Summary

Choosing the right collaboration tools can:
- Reduce team communication costs
- Help AI better understand project context
- Improve overall development efficiency

A good toolchain is the foundation for efficient AI-assisted development.
