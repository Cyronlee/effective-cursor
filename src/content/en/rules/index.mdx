## What are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules are project-level configuration rules in Cursor AI editor. By defining specifications in the `.cursorrules` file, you can help AI better understand your project structure, tech stack, and coding style, resulting in code that better matches your project requirements.

## How to Use?

1. **Browse Rule Sets**: Select your project type from the left navigation (e.g., Next.js + shadcn/ui)
2. **View Rule Details**: Each project type contains multiple rule files covering different aspects
3. **Copy to Project**: Use the copy button in the Playground component to copy rules to your `.cursorrules` file
4. **Customize as Needed**: Modify and customize these rules based on your actual project requirements

## Rule Categories

### Global Rules
- Universal specifications applicable to the entire project
- Includes tech stack, directory structure, coding standards, etc.
- Typically set with `alwaysApply: true`

### Specific Rules
- Rules targeting specific file types or directories
- Specify application scope through the `globs` field
- Such as routing rules, UI component rules, etc.
