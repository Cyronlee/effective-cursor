# Spring Boot Ruleset

This is a comprehensive set of Cursor Rules designed for Spring Boot + Spring Data JPA + PostgreSQL technology stack. By converting project standards into AI-understandable rules, Cursor can automatically follow team technical standards and best practices during development.

## Rules Overview

| Rule File | Scope | Core Content | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Global Rules**<br/>`global-rules.mdc` | Entire project<br/>`alwaysApply: true` | Tech stack definition, package structure<br/>Layering conventions, dependency injection | Ensure consistent<br/>project architecture and code style |
| **API Contract**<br/>`api-contract.mdc` | `controller/**/*.java` | URL design, response structure<br/>Parameter binding conventions | Standardize RESTful API<br/>design patterns |
| **Auth Security**<br/>`auth-security.mdc` | `controller/**`<br/>`service/**` | Authentication methods, user context<br/>Permission validation patterns | Standardize security-related<br/>implementations |
| **Exception Handling**<br/>`exception-error-code.mdc` | `exception/**`<br/>`controller/**`<br/>`service/**` | Exception hierarchy, error codes<br/>Global exception handling | Unified error handling<br/>and response format |
| **Integration Test**<br/>`integration-test.mdc` | `src/test/**/*.java` | Test base class, MockMvc<br/>Test data preparation, assertion style | Standardize test code<br/>writing practices |

## Usage

Add these rule files to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory. Cursor will automatically apply the appropriate rules based on file paths and `globs` configuration:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name=".cursor" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="rules" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="global-rules.mdc" />
      <FileTree.File name="api-contract.mdc" />
      <FileTree.File name="auth-security.mdc" />
      <FileTree.File name="exception-error-code.mdc" />
      <FileTree.File name="integration-test.mdc" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Features

- **Layered Design**: Precise scope control through `alwaysApply` and `globs`
- **Tech Stack Bound**: Optimized specifically for Spring Boot 3.x + JPA ecosystem
- **Best Practices**: Includes enterprise-level best practices for layered architecture, exception handling, and security
- **Test First**: Built-in integration test conventions to ensure code quality

## Extension Suggestions

Based on project needs, you can add more rule files:

- **Data Access Rules**: JPA Repository conventions for `repository/**`
- **DTO Rules**: Data transfer object design conventions
- **Cache Rules**: Redis/local cache usage conventions
- **Message Queue Rules**: Kafka/RabbitMQ integration conventions

This allows you to build a complete, layered rule system that helps AI assistants better understand and follow project conventions.

## Rules Extraction Template

If you want to extract conventions from an existing Spring Boot project, you can use the following prompt template:

# Spring Boot Project Conventions Extraction Task

You are now a highly experienced senior Java backend architect, specializing in reverse-engineering and summarizing **project-specific mandatory conventions** from existing Spring Boot project code.

## Task

Based on the project code snippets I provide (including directory structure, representative classes, configuration files, annotation usage, etc.), summarize the high-level content for the following **5 convention documents** for this project, to be saved in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.

## Principles

Strictly adhere to the following principles:

1. Only write conventions that **actually exist and are repeatedly enforced** in this project. **Do not write** general LLM knowledge, textbook best practices, or generic online advice.

   - For example, don't write things like "functions should have single responsibility", "use lombok", "use @Validated for parameter validation" that everyone knows, unless the project has very specific, non-standard mandatory conventions or special approaches.

2. Keep each document under **300 lines**, with concise, clear, and actionable language.

3. **Only include** key import locations and representative code snippets (3-10 lines recommended) **when truly necessary to clarify usage, reduce ambiguity, or when the project's approach significantly deviates from standard practice**.

   - If the rule itself is already clear enough, or if the project's approach aligns with mainstream practices, don't include code.
   - Don't force code examples just to fill space.

4. The rule documents are intended for **Cursor Rules** to improve AI generation quality, so optimize for LLM attention.

## 5 Documents to Summarize

Only summarize high-level content, focusing on what the project actually enforces uniquely, without over-detailing implementation:

### 1. Global Development Conventions (`global.mdc` + `global-development.mdc`)

- Focus on: Tech stack, package structure and layer boundaries, dependency injection approach, Service layer design patterns
- Set `alwaysApply: true` in `global.mdc`, with core conventions
- Include detailed explanations in `global-development.mdc`

### 2. API Contract Conventions (`api-contract.mdc`)

- Focus on: URL design style, versioning approach, unified response structure, Controller writing conventions

### 3. Exception and Error Code Conventions (`exception-error-code.mdc`)

- Focus on: Exception class hierarchy, business exception throwing timing and encapsulation, error code encoding rules (digits, prefixes, allocation principles), global exception handling main strategies

### 4. Authentication and Security Conventions (`auth-security.mdc`)

- Focus on: Actual authentication scheme used in the project and core flow, how to get current user information, which encapsulated tools are available but should not be modified

### 5. Integration Test Conventions (`integration-test.mdc`)

- Focus on: Test base classes, test class organization, test data preparation approaches, encapsulated test utility classes
