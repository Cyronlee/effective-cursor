# Vite + Shadcn/UI Rules

This is a comprehensive Cursor Rules collection for Vite + React + TypeScript + Shadcn/UI stack. By transforming project conventions into AI-understandable rules, Cursor automatically follows your team's technical standards and best practices during development.

## Rules Overview

| Rule File | Scope | Content | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|
| **Global Rules**<br/>`global-rules.mdc` | Entire project<br/>`alwaysApply: true` | Tech stack definition, directory structure<br/>TypeScript standards, import conventions | Ensure consistency in project<br/>architecture and code style |
| **Routing Rules**<br/>`routing-rules.mdc` | `src/pages/**` | Page file structure, route protection<br/>User authentication | Standardize code organization<br/>and security practices at routing layer |
| **UI Rules**<br/>`ui-rules.mdc` | `*.tsx` | Shadcn/UI component usage<br/>Icon system, notification system | Unify UI component usage<br/>and interface style |
| **API Rules**<br/>`api-rules.mdc` | `src/clients/**` | API client architecture, SWR integration<br/>HTTP methods, error handling | Standardize API calling patterns<br/>and data fetching practices |

## How to Use

Add these rule files to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory, and Cursor will automatically apply the corresponding rules based on file paths and `globs` configuration:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name=".cursor" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="rules" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="global-rules.mdc" />
      <FileTree.File name="routing-rules.mdc" />
      <FileTree.File name="ui-rules.mdc" />
      <FileTree.File name="api-rules.mdc" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Key Features

- **Layered Design**: Precise scope control through `alwaysApply` and `globs`
- **Stack-Specific**: Optimized specifically for Vite + React + Shadcn/UI ecosystem
- **Best Practices**: Includes TypeScript standards, code organization, and security authentication
- **Team Collaboration**: Makes implicit knowledge explicit, reducing onboarding time for new members

## Extension Suggestions

You can add more rule files based on project needs:

- **State Management Rules**: Zustand store conventions for `src/stores/**`
- **Testing Rules**: Test file writing standards
- **Style Rules**: Tailwind CSS usage conventions
- **Form Rules**: React Hook Form handling standards

This approach builds a complete, layered rule system that helps AI assistants better understand and follow project conventions.

## Rules Extraction Template

If you want to extract conventions from an existing Vite + React project, you can use the following prompt template:

````md
# Vite + React Project Conventions Extraction Task

You are now a highly experienced senior frontend architect, specializing in reverse-engineering and summarizing **project-specific mandatory conventions** from existing Vite + React + TypeScript project code.

## Task

Based on the project code snippets I provide (including directory structure, representative components, configuration files, dependency usage, etc.), summarize the high-level content for the following **4 convention documents** for this project, to be saved in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.

## Principles

Strictly adhere to the following principles:

1. Only write conventions that **actually exist and are repeatedly enforced** in this project. **Do not write** general LLM knowledge, textbook best practices, or generic online advice.

   - For example, don't write things like "components should have single responsibility", "use ESLint", "define types for Props" that everyone knows, unless the project has very specific, non-standard mandatory conventions or special approaches.

2. Keep each document under **300 lines**, with concise, clear, and actionable language.

3. **Only include** key import locations and representative code snippets (3-10 lines recommended) **when truly necessary to clarify usage, reduce ambiguity, or when the project's approach significantly deviates from standard practice**.

   - If the rule itself is already clear enough, or if the project's approach aligns with mainstream practices, don't include code.
   - Don't force code examples just to fill space.

4. The rule documents are intended for **Cursor Rules** to improve AI generation quality, so optimize for LLM attention.

## 4 Documents to Summarize

Only summarize high-level content, focusing on what the project actually enforces uniquely, without over-detailing implementation:

### 1. Global Development Conventions (`global-rules.mdc`)

- Focus on: Tech stack, directory structure and module boundaries, TypeScript configuration and type definition conventions, import path conventions (alias, relative path usage rules)
- Set `alwaysApply: true`

### 2. Routing Conventions (`routing-rules.mdc`)

- Focus on: Route file organization, page component naming and structure, route protection and permission control, navigation methods (Link vs useNavigate)

### 3. UI Component Conventions (`ui-rules.mdc`)

- Focus on: UI component library used in the project (Shadcn/UI, Ant Design, etc.), component import and usage patterns, icon system, global component usage conventions (notifications/modals, etc.), styling approach (CSS Modules, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.)

### 4. API and Data Fetching Conventions (`api-rules.mdc`)

- Focus on: API client architecture (axios, fetch, etc.), data fetching library (SWR, React Query, etc.), request/response interceptors, error handling and retry strategies, type definition approaches
