# Vite + Shadcn/UI Rules

This is a comprehensive Cursor Rules collection for Vite + React + TypeScript + Shadcn/UI stack. By transforming project conventions into AI-understandable rules, Cursor automatically follows your team's technical standards and best practices during development.

## Rules Overview

| Rule File | Scope | Content | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|
| **Global Rules**<br/>`global-rules.mdc` | Entire project<br/>`alwaysApply: true` | Tech stack definition, directory structure<br/>TypeScript standards, import conventions | Ensure consistency in project<br/>architecture and code style |
| **Routing Rules**<br/>`routing-rules.mdc` | `src/pages/**` | Page file structure, route protection<br/>User authentication | Standardize code organization<br/>and security practices at routing layer |
| **UI Rules**<br/>`ui-rules.mdc` | `*.tsx` | Shadcn/UI component usage<br/>Icon system, notification system | Unify UI component usage<br/>and interface style |
| **API Rules**<br/>`api-rules.mdc` | `src/clients/**` | API client architecture, SWR integration<br/>HTTP methods, error handling | Standardize API calling patterns<br/>and data fetching practices |

## How to Use

Add these rule files to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory, and Cursor will automatically apply the corresponding rules based on file paths and `globs` configuration:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name=".cursor" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="rules" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="global-rules.mdc" />
      <FileTree.File name="routing-rules.mdc" />
      <FileTree.File name="ui-rules.mdc" />
      <FileTree.File name="api-rules.mdc" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Key Features

- **Layered Design**: Precise scope control through `alwaysApply` and `globs`
- **Stack-Specific**: Optimized specifically for Vite + React + Shadcn/UI ecosystem
- **Best Practices**: Includes TypeScript standards, code organization, and security authentication
- **Team Collaboration**: Makes implicit knowledge explicit, reducing onboarding time for new members

## Extension Suggestions

You can add more rule files based on project needs:

- **State Management Rules**: Zustand store conventions for `src/stores/**`
- **Testing Rules**: Test file writing standards
- **Style Rules**: Tailwind CSS usage conventions
- **Form Rules**: React Hook Form handling standards

This approach builds a complete, layered rule system that helps AI assistants better understand and follow project conventions.
