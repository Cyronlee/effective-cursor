# Prompts Collection

<Callout type="info">
This collection contains battle-tested solution prompts and meta prompts to help you generate rules.
</Callout>

## What is the Prompts Collection?

The prompts collection consists of reusable, practice-verified prompt templates. They can help you quickly solve common development problems or serve as starting points for generating project rules.

## How to Use?

1. **Browse Prompts**: Select a category from the left navigation (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Blog)
2. **Copy Prompts**: Find the prompt that suits your needs and copy it to Cursor's chat window
3. **Minor Adjustments**: Make minor tweaks based on your specific project requirements
4. **Direct Use**: Since the main guide already covers how to configure Cursor Rules, using these prompts directly won't cause too many side effects

<Callout type="warning">
If you're concerned about potential issues, you can refer to the PRD-Solution pattern in the workflow to regenerate solutions for your project.
</Callout>

## Usage Example

Here's a typical way to use these prompts:

<ChatExample mode="Agent" model="claude-4.5-sonnet">
{`Reference @rules directory structure, create a parallel prompts directory

### Add index.mdx introduction

This directory is for sharing settled solution prompts

Introduce how to use these prompts, ready to use with minor modifications, for example implementing
@solution.md`}
</ChatExample>
